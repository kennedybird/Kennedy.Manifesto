        <h1 class="title">Design as Repair: Restoring What Extraction Has Broken</h1>
        
        <p class="intro">The climate crisis is here. Every material I choose, every product I design, every system I support, these choices either heal or hurt fragile relationships between humans and the living world. In its current state, design's value to humanity feels broken. Not just in terms of the objects that end up in landfills, but something much deeper: the connection it shares with ecosystems, communities, and its own artistic merit.</p>

        <p>A tool that artists have used to express themselves freely and create beautiful intricacies such as the sistine chapel or the Mayan temples has devolved into extraction: taking resources from communities who never benefit. We've ultimately designed a culture of disposability and erasure where fast fashion latches onto trends that last a season and globalized aesthetics are hyper focused on a 'one size fits all' mantra. Our culture worships novelty and teaches us that throwing away is easier than caring.</p>

        <p>This manifesto argues that design must shift. We must move away from the never ending output of soulless design that feeds the mouth of rampant consumerism and instead turn to repairing relationships. Real sustainability isn't just about doing less harm. It's about actively healing what we've broken. That takes Carol Sanford's non-heroic approach. Designers can't swoop in with universal solutions. Instead, we work alongside communities. Often, the best knowledge already exists in the places we're trying to "help."</p>

        <h2>The Three Pillars of Repair-Centered Design</h2>

        <div class="section-number">[ PILLAR 01 ]</div>
        <h3>1. Repairing Material Relationships: Circular Systems and the Five Capitals</h3>

        <p>The linear economy, take, make, waste, is a design failure. Circular systems offer a way forward. They eliminate waste by design, keep materials cycling at their highest value, and regenerate nature through an equitable give and take. However it's not just about recycling; it's about seeing materials as nutrients and not commodities.</p>

        <p>Taking a closer look at The Five Capitals concept: natural (ecosystems), social (community relationships), human (skills), manufactured (tools), and financial (money) we can see that there is a fundamental disconnect within traditional design that often drains natural capital while concentrating financial capital. Repair-centered design tries to rebuild all five at once.</p>

        <p>For example, Fairphone makes modular smartphones where every part can be replaced with a screwdriver. That preserves manufactured capital and builds human capital through repair skills. Patagonia's Worn Wear program celebrates repaired jackets, strengthening social bonds through community repair events. When we build repair infrastructure, we're building human capital, social capital, and natural capital all at the same time.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            Repair-centered designers ask: Can this be taken apart? What happens if it breaks? Which capitals does this design build, and which does it drain? We provide repair manuals, use locally sourced materials, and make modular systems.
        </div>

        <p>But circularity alone isn't enough. If we only make consumption more efficient without asking who benefits, we're just dressing up inequality in green. I think circularity has to come with justice.</p>

        <div class="section-number">[ PILLAR 02 ]</div>
        <h3>2. Repairing Community Relationships: Intersectional Justice and Transition Design</h3>

        <p>Environmental justice and social justice go hand in hand. Research says that communities of color, Indigenous peoples, low-income communities, and the Global South bear the heaviest burden of extraction and climate destruction. A design practice that ignores this isn't solving the crisis, it's repeating it.</p>

        <p>I've learned that Transition Design matters here. We can't just design better products, we need to design transitions toward just and regenerative futures. Transition Design asks us to take the long view, work at multiple scales, and accept that change is messy and non-linear.</p>

        <p>Many Indigenous communities have practiced regenerative design for centuries. Learning from them requires humility, partnership, and the sharing of power. We can't simply take this knowledge away from them. This can be sourced from Sanford's non-heroic approach in action. There is no room for the so-called 'savior complex' baked into the history of colonialism.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "Who benefits? Who gets hurt? Who's been left out?"
        </div>

        <p>Designing with communities means asking: Who benefits? Who gets hurt? Who's been left out? We map the full web of relationships: who extracted the materials, who made the goods, who profits, who discards it, and who suffers.</p>

        <h4>Concrete actions:</h4>
        <p>Instead of designing "solutions" for the Global South, support their existing repair systems and knowledge holders. Partner with local craftspeople and pay them fairly. Challenge carbon offset schemes that let wealthy nations keep polluting while shifting the burden elsewhere. Build systems that tackle the root problem, not just the symptoms.</p>

        <p>Repair means restoring trust, acknowledging harm, and letting those who've been doing regenerative work for generations lead.</p>

        <div class="section-number">[ PILLAR 03 ]</div>
        <h3>3. Repairing Place Relationships: Regenerative and Localized Design</h3>

        <p>Regenerative design sees us as part of nature, not separate from it. Every design decision affects soil, water, air, and biodiversity. Our work should help them thrive, not harm them.</p>

        <p>But we can't apply one-size-fits-all solutions. Every place is different: climate, ecology, culture, history. Regenerative design honors those differences. We should treat each place with curiosity!!</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            Ask: What does this place need? What can we source locally? What knowledge is already here? Work with local materials and craftspeople. Design with seasonal cycles and local ecosystems.
        </div>

        <p>Repair-centered design rejects globalized aesthetics that makes everywhere look the same. It finds beauty in local variation, celebrates regional craft traditions, and values rootedness over scalability.</p>

        <h2>Repairing Time and Culture: From Novelty to Longevity</h2>

        <p>Our culture worships the "new", but the climate crisis forces us to rethink the longevity of constant disposal. We instead need to accept imperfection. Chasing the newest, on-trend product drives such disposability. What if  "good enough to repair" became the norm?</p>

        <p>Repair means designing for longevity. Products should last decades, maybe develop some patina. Let your sweater tell a story to your grandkids of how you wore it out berry-picking. If I've learned anything in my 21 years, it's that imperfection tells a story that shiny newness cannot.</p>

        <p>What's so cool is that visible mending becomes a fashion statement. It says "I care." Repair cafes turn into community spaces where people share skills and stories. Leather that's soft because it's been well used and denim that is worn and develops cool patterns based on how your body has grown into them. These precious items carry all of our little stories! And that's something we should be proud of. Think about how cool it is to pass on an heirloom.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "Every repair manual, every story of a saved object, is a small rebellion against disposability."
        </div>

        <p>Thus, we need repair infrastructure: accessible tools, clear guides, and local networks. Our rhetoric needs to remind us that fixing things is empowering and that keeping objects for decades is a badge of honor. I hope we can learn that every repair manual, every story of a saved object, is a small rebellion against disposability.</p>

        <h2>What Repair Requires of Us: Humility, Discernment, and Grief</h2>

        <p><strong>Humility</strong> means admitting we don't have all the answers. Sometimes the best intervention is less design, not more. Learn from people already doing repair work.</p>

        <p><strong>Discernment</strong> means rejecting false solutions. Not every "green" product fixes anything. Greenwashing is everywhere. Ask: Whose interests does this serve? Who pays the cost?</p>

        <p><strong>Grief</strong> means accepting loss. Species, ecosystems, communities, ways of life. They've been destroyed in the name of progress. Repair work isn't glamorous. We do it anyway, imperfectly, but sincerely.</p>

        <h2>An Invitation: Designing Interconnections</h2>

        <p>This manifesto invites us to stop designing for a dying system. Listen to those doing regenerative work for generations. Reject endless growth. Accept limits. Choose repair over replacement, relationships over consumption, healing over harm.</p>

        <p>Repair-centered design sees connections between environment, society, technology, designers, and future generations. You can't fix one without thinking about it all. Designing repairable products also means assessing social practices, environmental impacts, and our role as designers in restoring value within the things we create.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            We are part of nature. Dependent on it. Responsible for it. The question isn't whether we can design our way out of the climate crisis. It's whether we can repair what extraction has broken.
        </div>

        <p>The relationships between humans and ecosystems. Between those who extract and those extracted from. Between present and future. Between consumption and care.</p>
